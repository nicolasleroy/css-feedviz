# CSS FeedViz

## Updates

* [January 2025]: Updated [TransferCSSProducts Java System Properties](#transfercssproducts-system-properties) support to include options for CSS Center account information and BigQuery insertion batch size.

* [August 2024]: Introduced multi-threading to process the streaming of CSS Products from the [Comparison Shopping Service API](https://developers.google.com/comparison-shopping-services/api/overview) to [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

* [June 2024]: Modified the codebase to stream CSS Products into BigQuery instead of using the [insertAll method](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery/latest/com.google.cloud.bigquery.BigQuery#com_google_cloud_bigquery_BigQuery_insertAll_com_google_cloud_bigquery_InsertAllRequest_) due to hitting payload size issues.


## Overview

CSS FeedViz provides the means for viewing detailed attribute data on disapproved products that have been submitted to the CSS API. The provided information will improve the speed and accuracy with which CSSs will be able to respond to product disapprovals.


## Before you begin

As the CSS FeedViz dashboard uses the [Comparison Shopping Service API](https://developers.google.com/comparison-shopping-services/api/overview) and [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) for data retrieval and storage, you need a [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) and a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create). You will need to enable both the [CSS API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/css.googleapis.com) and [BigQuery API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/bigquery.googleapis.com) in your Google Cloud project.


## Required permissions

The service account that you chose to use for CSS FeedViz requires certain access permissions both in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts) and on [CSS Center](https://developers.google.com/comparison-shopping-services/api/guides/quickstart#permissions). 


### Google CSS Center

The email address of the service account needs to be added with _Admin_ access permissions to your CSS group or domain account in Google CSS Center.


### Google Cloud

The service account requires rights for getting, creating and updating both [datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro) and [tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables-intro) within BigQuery. The `bigquery.dataEditor` predefined IAM role provides adequate permissions for these purposes. In Google Cloud, add the `bigquery.dataEditor` IAM role to the service account. Instructions on how to manage IAM roles for service accounts can be found at: \
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts.


## CSS Products Transfer


### Configuration Files

CSS Feedviz uses the [Comparison Shopping Services API](https://developers.google.com/comparison-shopping-services/api/guides/quickstart) to retrieve products at CSS domain level. Using this API requires a JSON private key file for the service account, which can be obtained from Google Cloud by following the instructions at: \
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating

Once you’ve obtained the JSON private key file, rename it as `service-account.json` and store it in 

```
$(HOME)/css-feedviz/config
```

In order to provide CSS FeedViz with the relevant CSS Center account information, copy the test account-info.json file from `$(HOME)/css-feedviz/config/test` to `$(HOME)/css-feedviz/config` and modify its contents as needed. The file contains a JSON object with the following fields:

| Field name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| groupId | number | The CSS Group ID. |
| domainId | number | The CSS Domain ID to retrieve products for. |
| domainIds | array of numbers | The CSS Domain IDs to retrieve products for. Use this instead of `domainId` when loading several domains from the same CSS Group ID. |

CSS FeedViz may also be provided with the CSS Center account information via [Java System Properties](#transfercssproducts-system-properties). In the event that both System Properties and an account information JSON file are provided, the System Properties take precedence.

### Transfer Execution

The CSS FeedViz codebase is managed by [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), with the `pom.xml` configuration file located in the `css-feedviz` root directory. To compile the codebase, execute the following command from `$(HOME)/css-feedviz`.

```
mvn compile
```

Once the code has been successfully compiled, execute the following command to transfer product data from the Comparison Shopping Services API to BigQuery.

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.cssfeedviz.TransferCssProducts"
```

## Looker Studio Dashboard

To access the CSS FeedViz Looker Studio dashboard template, first [join the CSS FeedViz Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/css-feedviz/). Once you’ve joined, make a copy of [this Looker Studio template](https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/u/0/reporting/94023eb5-ce2f-445a-94c5-63112318de63/page/TLFIC/preview).

Configure the Looker Studio [BigQuery Connector](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/topic/10587734) to connect to the css\_products\_[CSS Domain ID] BigQuery table that has been created by the CSS Products data transfer. This can be done under the **Resource** > **Manage added data sources** menu item in Looker Studio. Further information on configuring the Looker Studio BigQuery connector can be found [here](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6370296).

Once properly configured, you should have a dashboard with two populated pages, one with a CSS level attributes and the other with Product level attributes.

## Technical Details

### TransferCssProducts System Properties

The TransferCssProducts service supports the following Java System Properties to allow for greater customisation of functionality.

| System property | Default value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| feedviz.account.info.domain.id | `null` | The CSS Domain ID to retrieve products for. |
| feedviz.account.info.domain.ids | `null` | Comma-separated CSS Domain IDs to retrieve products for. This takes precedence over `feedviz.account.info.domain.id`. |
| feedviz.account.info.group.id | `null` | The CSS Group ID. |
| feedviz.account.info.file | `"account-info.json"` | Name of file containing CSS Center account details. |
| feedviz.config.dir | `"./config"` | Path to directory containing configuration files |
| feedviz.dataset.location | `"EU"` | Location of Google Cloud servers where data will be stored/processed. |
| feedviz.dataset.name | `"css_feedviz"` | Name of the dataset that will be used/created in BigQuery. |
| feedviz.insert.batch.size | `"100"` | The batch size when inserting products into BigQuery. |

### CSS Products Schema

The schema of each css\_products\_[CSS Domain ID] table in BigQuery aligns with the [CssProduct resource in CSS API](https://developers.devsite.corp.google.com/comparison-shopping-services/api/reference/rest/v1/accounts.cssProducts) as follows:
